# PacificRetail
The Pacific Retail project built a data pipeline using ADLS for storage and Snowflake for processing. Data moved through three layers: bronze (raw), silver (transformed), and gold (business logic). Snowflake features like external stages, COPY INTO, and time travel were used , with the final output available for BI tools.
