In the Pacific Retail project, I built a data pipeline using ADLS for storage and Snowflake for processing. The data moved through three layers: bronze (raw), silver (transformed), and gold (business logic). I utilized Snowflake features like external stages, COPY INTO, and time travel for efficient data management, with the final data available for BI tools.
